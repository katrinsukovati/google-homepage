A fun and simple mini project where I recreated the Google Search homepage to practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills. This project focused on building a clean and visually accurate interface, emphasizing layout structure, text styling, and basic responsive design. The main objective was to mimic the look and feel of Google’s homepage while reinforcing core front-end concepts.
